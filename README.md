# Chromaptic

Chromaptic is a visualization of the colors representing cities in the United States. The program parses photos from different cities posted to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) into the clarifai API, to return the dominant color of the photos, which are then visualized on a map. Users are then able to hover their mouse over the map markers to get a preview of a photo from that city, and are able to experience that city's "color."

The motivation behind this hack was to determine if there exists a color that best represents a city. Is Los Angeles more blue? Is Phoenix more orange? By building this program, we were able to see that in fact, this is true!
